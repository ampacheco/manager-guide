**About**

1:1s are time to work together on your career. During that time we will talk about how your week is going, follow-up on goals, and figure out how to unblock any challenges. 1:1s are also great time for giving and receiving feedback.

**Frequency**

I prefer to have 30 minute 1:1s each week and we can decide together on a time that works best. 

**Agenda**

I expect you to come prepared with items you want to talk about. Typically, I'll have a standard set of questions every 1:1, as described in this [template](https://github.com/meaghanlewis/manager-guide/blob/master/1-1s/1-1-template.md), and am always open to discussing other things on your mind as well. 

**Artifacts**

I will take notes and share them in our 1:1 repo, but feel free to take your own notes as well.
