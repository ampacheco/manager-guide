I like to set goals on a quarterly basis and check in on them regularly. My expectation is that my team will set goals and we will review progress on goals on a monthly basis.

In addition, I value end of year self-reviews. These are optional, but a great chance to look back at your work over the past year, and think about what went well and were you want to grow in the next year. It's also a great chance to get a head start on your self-review for the annual performance review.
