## Quarterly
I like to set goals on a quarterly basis and check in on them regularly. My expectation is that my team will set goals and we will review progress on goals on a monthly basis.

**Tips:**
- Set **SMART** goals.That's Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time bound
- Answer the question: "What skills do I want to improve?" and "How can I get those skills?"
- Include both technical goals and interpersonal goals

## End of year
In addition, I value end of year self-reviews. These are optional, but a great chance to look back at your work over the past year, and think about what went well and were you want to grow in the next year. It's also a great chance to get a head start on your self-review for the annual performance review.

Since this spans a whole year, it's good to make a timeline of events to remember what happened when. Look through past 1:1 notes, contribution activity, and feedback from your team. Also review your goals for the past year and reflect on them noting what you met and what you didn't.

```
End of year review template


What were my key accomplishments and contributions over the last twelve months (both individually and collaboratively for my team)?


What 3-5 priorities am I going to focus on next year to make myself, the team, and org more successful?


What will I do and what do I need, to keep learning and growing?


Describe future roles that interest you in growing your career and what actions you will take to learn more about these opportunities. (examples - areas of technology, management, new discipline, new geography, etc).
