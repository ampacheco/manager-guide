Outside of 1:1s together, there will be other regularly scheduled meetings that we have as a team. Those include:
## Team syncs
Once a week for 30 minutes to catch up on announcements, changes, and to have discussions.

## Sprint planning
At the beginning of each sprint to finalize what we will work on in the next sprint.

## Retrospectives
Once per month to look back at how we've been performing.

## Team hangs 
Twice a month time set aside for us to just catch up on life.
