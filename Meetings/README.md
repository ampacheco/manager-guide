Outside of 1:1s together, there will be other regularly scheduled meetings that we have as a team. Those include:
## Team syncs
- Once a week to catch up on announcements, changes, and to have discussions.
- 30 minutes

## Sprint planning
- At the beginning of each sprint to finalize what we will work on in the next sprint
- Typically lasts 30 - 60 minutes.

## Retrospectives
- At the end of each sprint to look back at how we've been performing and what can be improved. 
- Typically lasts 30 - 60 minutes.

## Team hangs 
- Time set aside for us to just catch up on life and talk about things outside of work.
- Typically lasts 30 minutes.
