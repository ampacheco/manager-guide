# My personal manager guide.
:wave: I'm Meaghan. If you've stumbled across this it's likely because we either work together, will work together, or have worked together in the past. The goal of this repo is to have a better idea about who I am and how I work as a manager.

Check out my [human user guide](https://github.com/meaghanlewis/manager-guide/blob/master/human-user-guide.md) for more detailed information about working with me.

## Purpose
As a manager, I want you to feel empowered to not just do the job today, but also plan and document your career and goals so I can help you grow. I'm excited to work with you and build great things.

It's also important that I help our project ship iteratively and often.

I aim to continuously learn and improve, so that I can do my best, and enable my teammates do their best too. With that being said, I welcome all feedback. Let me know if there are things that I can be doing to make the team better. And I will provide you regular feedback as well.

## My role
As an EM, I am committed to:
- Helping the team ship often and on time
- Helping to define what success looks like on the team
- Removing blockers from the team
- Providing regular feedback
- Setting goals with you to advance your career at GitHub
- Finding opportunities to challenge you
- Providing 2 formal performance reviews per year
