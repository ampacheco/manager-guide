# My personal manager guide.
:wave: I'm Meaghan. If you've stumbled across this it's likely because we either work together, will work together, or have worked together in the past. The goal of this repo is to have a better idea about who I am and how I work as a manager. I hope that this guide will help you understand how to work with me.

Check out my [human user guide](https://github.com/meaghanlewis/manager-guide/blob/master/human-user-guide.md) for more detailed information about working with me.

## Purpose
As a manager, I want you to feel empowered to not just do the job today, but also plan and document your career so I can help you grow and be successful in work and in life. My goal is to help you be a great staff member here, but also set you up for success wherever your career takes you. Let's use this space to figure out how we will work together to make this happen. Look at everything in this document as a strong suggestion, but not an edict, or precise and perfect process - if the process below isn't working, let's find a new way to do it that works for both of us.

My goal as a manager is to help my teammates grow and help our project succeed. I aim to continuously learn and improve, so that I can do my best, and help my teammates do their best too.
