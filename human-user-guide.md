- What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
  -  A common thing I'm told is that I always have a calm demeanor and am hard to read. This means I don't usually get overly excited or overly angry. I do this for many reasons, the biggest probably being that I don't want to come off as overly emotional. It doesn't mean that I don't care.

**About my colleagues**

- What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
  - I value those that are hardworking and able to be self-starters who don't wait for instructions but strive to get things done.

  - Put other people down.
  
- How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
  - Be empathetic.

**About my interactions**

- How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
  - Most coaching will happen in 1:1s. I expect my teammates to be self-motivated, hardworking and have autonomy. I believe we can work together best that way. If there are specific things you would like to work on, I expect you to bring those things up to me so I can do my best to work with you to find a solution.

- What’s the best way to communicate with you?
  - Slack will be the easiest way to get in touch with me. I might not respond immediately, but I will definitely respond within a few hours. If you have a quick question, please just ask in Slack. If there is something that requires a conversation, I am happy to jump on a quick zoom call. You can also feel free to schedule time on my calendar wherever there is availability.

- What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
  - Tell me what the results will be.
  - Tell me the impact that it will have with our metrics.
  - Tell me how it will impact our users.

- How do you like to give feedback?
  - As soon as possible and as subjectively as possible. 
  - Depending on the type of feedback, it could be a quick Slack message. If it is more sensitive feedback, it should happen over a Zoom call.

- How do you like to get feedback?
  - I value all feedback and encourage a culture of continuous feedback so that it feels more comfortable for everyone to be giving and receiving feedback.
