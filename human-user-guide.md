**About my interactions**

- How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?

- What’s the best way to communicate with you?
  - Slack will be the easiest way to get in touch with me. I might not respond immediately, but I will definitely respond within a few hours. If you have a quick question, please just ask in Slack.

  - I like to provide praise in public, and criticize in private.

- How do you like to get feedback?
